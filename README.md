My entry for CST-310 Project 6 - Specular Lighting, Objects, Illumination and Shaders.

To run the program:

Download the Project6 files from the GitHub repository 
Save them to the same directory and open that directory in the Ubuntu terminal 
Use the following commands to run the program and display the scene: 'g++ Project6.cpp -o Project6 -ldl -lglfw -lglut' './Project6'. 
Packages ldl, lglfw and lglut are used to run this program, which can be obtained by using command 'sudo apt-get install libGL-dev'

Camera controls/UI Interaction: 
Scroll wheel to zoom in and out
Move mouse to control camera and set desired position
